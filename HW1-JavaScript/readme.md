# Homework 1 - JavaScript

The program takes the name of a comma-delimited text file (CSV) as input on the command line, sorts the file by the first field
using bubble sort, and prints the sorted file on the command line.

## Setup

The JavaScript program will be run from the command line using `node.js` which is available from https://nodejs.org/en/. 
Text files to be sorted must be placed into the same directory as the `hw1.js` file. An example `input.txt` file is provided.

## Running

From the command line:

```
node hw1.js <filename>.txt
```

## Notes:

The implementation of bubble sort used in the code is adapted from `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithms-by-using-javascript/`.
