# Homework 3 - Haskell

The function accepts a list as a parameter, sorts the list in ascending order using quicksort, and returns the sorted list.

## Setup

Assuming `ghci` is installed, pen the terminal and navigate to the folder containing `hw3.hs`. When in the folder, type `ghci` into the terminal
to start the ghci interpreter.

## Running

From the command line:

```
:l hw3.hs
quicksort <list>
```

Example: `quicksort [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]`
